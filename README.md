# Python Training Day 2

This README file provide a brief summary of what I have learned in this module.


## Types of Control Structures:

- **Sequential**:
Programs work sequebtialy by default.

- **Selection**:
Conditions are checked to make decisions. 

- **Repetition**:
Used for looping so we can repeatedly execute a piece of code. 

### Selection Control Structures:

- Only if.
- if-else.
- The nested if.
- The Complete if-elif-else.

### Repetition Control Structures:

- For Loop.
- The While Loop.

## Functions: 

- We can call the function using the function name followed parenthesis.
- Information can be passed into functions as arguments (arguments/arbitrary arguments/keyword arguments/arbitrary keyword arguments).
- We can return a value from a function using the "return" statement. 
- If we have a function with no content yet (during the development), we can use "pass" statement to avoid getting any errors. 
- A function can call itself, this feature is called function recursion.
- We can specify the types of function arguments and return values, this feature is called function annotation.
- Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions and can be returned from functions.


## Modules:
- A module is a file that contains functions or variables. 
- Modules allow us to organize the code logically and promote code reusability. 
- We can import modules in other Python scripts to use their functionality.
